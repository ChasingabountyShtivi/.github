# Chasing a bounty - Shtivi


Calling all cowpokes! If you’ve ever added bounty hunting, duels, or simply the ability to sit down on even more chairs in your Red Dead Redemption 2 game, you’ve probably come across today’s interviewee: Shtivi. So, hitch your horse, hang your hat and join us for a campside chat!

Welcome Shtivi! It’s great to have you here with us, why don’t you tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into gaming, and modding after that?

Hi! My name is Ido, I am 28 and I live in Israel. My uncle installed Super Mario on our family computer when I was six years old and that's basically got me into gaming. 

As a teenager, I always loved experimenting with mods for the games I played. I would install skins, tweak the config files, and see what happened, just exploring. When Red Dead Redemption 2 came out for PC, I instantly fell in love with it. I had so many ideas on how to improve the game and what extra features I’d love to see as a fan. 

I do code for living, so I already had the necessary skills, so I thought, "Why not?". I remembered that GTA V has a massive modding community, so I figured it couldn't be impossible to create scripts for RDR2 too. In the end, what drives me is my passion.


If your uncle installed Super Mario on your family computer, modding and programming must have been in your life from a young age. Does your family know about your modding adventures nowadays?

That’s true! Programming, gaming, and modding have been hobbies of mine for a long time. I work as a software engineer and although I can spend a lot of hours a day coding at work, it doesn't get me too tired to code mods and games in my free time. I really love it. 

My family knows a bit about my mods, and even though none of them are gamers, they understand that it’s important to me. My wife has been very supportive throughout, even after I get her mad for dedicating too many hours on that.
